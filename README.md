# Java 2D Game Tutorial

This project follows [RyiSnow's Java 2D Game Development tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&ab_channel=RyiSnow), designed for beginners.

## ðŸ”§ About the Project

The goal is to build a 2D tile-based adventure game in Java, learning core concepts of game development such as:

- Game loops and rendering
